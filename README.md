# Movie-Recommendation-System

Everyone loves movies irrespective of age, gender, race, color, or geographical location. We all in a way are connected to each other via this amazing medium. Yet what most interesting is the fact that how unique our choices and combinations are in terms of movie preferences. Some people like genre-specific movies be it a thriller, romance, or sci-fi, while others focus on lead actors and directors. When we take all that into account, it's astoundingly difficult to generalize a movie and say that everyone would like it. But with all that said, it is still seen that similar movies are liked by a specific part of the society.

So here's where we as data scientists come into play and extract the juice out of all the behavioral patterns of not only the audience but also from the movies themselves. So without further ado let's jump right into the basics of a recommendation system.
